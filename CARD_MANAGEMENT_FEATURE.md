# Card Management Feature

## Overview
A complete card management system has been added to the user profile, allowing users to securely store and manage their payment cards.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema (User Model)
**File:** `models/User.js`

Added a `cards` array to the User schema with the following fields:
- `cardholderName`: String (required)
- `cardNumber`: String (required) - Stored securely, masked in API responses
- `expiryMonth`: String (required)
- `expiryYear`: String (required)
- `cvv`: String (required) - Stored for payment processing
- `isDefault`: Boolean - Marks the default payment method
- `createdAt`: Date - Timestamp of when card was added

### 2. API Routes

#### GET `/api/user/cards`
- Retrieves all cards for the logged-in user
- Returns masked card numbers (only last 4 digits visible)
- Requires authentication

#### POST `/api/user/cards`
- Adds a new card to the user's account
- Validates card number (13-19 digits)
- Validates expiry date format (MM/YYYY)
- Validates CVV (3-4 digits)
- Automatically sets first card as default
- Requires authentication

#### DELETE `/api/user/cards/[cardId]`
- Deletes a specific card
- If deleted card was default, sets first remaining card as default
- Requires authentication

#### PATCH `/api/user/cards/[cardId]`
- Updates card settings (primarily for setting default card)
- Unsets other cards when setting a new default
- Requires authentication

### 3. User Interface

#### New Tab in Profile Page
**File:** `app/(user-management)/profile/page.js`

Added "Payment Cards" tab with the following features:

**Features:**
- **View Cards**: Beautiful card-style display with gradient backgrounds
- **Add Card Form**: 
  - Cardholder name input
  - Card number input (auto-formatted with spaces)
  - Expiry date (month/year)
  - CVV input (password field)
  - Default card checkbox
- **Card Actions**:
  - Set as default
  - Delete card
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Default badge on primary card
  - Masked card numbers for security
  - Card expiry display
  - Empty state when no cards exist

**UI Components:**
- Modern, responsive design
- Green gradient card backgrounds
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Form validation
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Security Features

1. **Card Number Masking**: Only last 4 digits shown in UI
2. **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require valid session
3. **Input Validation**: 
   - Card number format validation
   - Expiry date validation
   - CVV format validation
4. **Secure Storage**: Card details stored in MongoDB with proper schema validation

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Navigate to your profile page
2. Click on "Payment Cards" tab in the sidebar
3. Click "Add Card" button
4. Fill in card details:
   - Cardholder name
   - 16-digit card number
   - Expiry month (MM)
   - Expiry year (YYYY)
   - CVV (3-4 digits)
5. Optionally check "Set as default payment method"
6. Click "Add Card" to save

### Managing Cards:
- **Set Default**: Click "Set as Default" button on any non-default card
- **Delete Card**: Click "Delete" button and confirm the action
- **View Details**: Card displays masked number, cardholder name, and expiry date

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add a new card successfully
- [ ] View saved cards with masked numbers
- [ ] Set a card as default
- [ ] Delete a card
- [ ] Verify first card is automatically set as default
- [ ] Verify form validation works (invalid card numbers, expiry dates, CVV)
- [ ] Verify authentication is required for all operations
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Card brand detection (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
2. Card verification with payment gateway
3. Encryption at rest for sensitive data
4. Card usage history
5. Billing address association
6. Support for multiple card types (credit/debit)
7. Integration with payment processing during checkout

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `app/api/user/cards/route.js` - Main cards API endpoint
- `app/api/user/cards/[cardId]/route.js` - Individual card operations
- `CARD_MANAGEMENT_FEATURE.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `models/User.js` - Added cards array to schema
- `app/(user-management)/profile/page.js` - Added Cards tab and functionality

## Notes

- Card data is stored in the database. For production, consider using a PCI-compliant payment service provider (like Stripe) to handle card storage
- CVV storage is generally not recommended for production; consider removing after initial payment
- Implement proper encryption for sensitive card data in production environments
- Consider implementing tokenization for enhanced security
