# Loyalty Points System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete loyalty points system where users earn **1 point per kilometer** ridden. Points are automatically calculated and awarded after each ride completion.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File:** `models/User.js`
- Added `loyaltyPoints` field (Number, default: 0) to User schema
- Points are stored directly in the user document for easy access

### 2. Automatic Points Award
**File:** `app/api/reservation/end/[id]/route.js`
- Modified ride end endpoint to automatically calculate and award loyalty points
- Formula: `Math.floor(distance)` = 1 point per km
- Points are awarded using MongoDB's `$inc` operator for atomic updates
- Graceful error handling - ride completion won't fail if points update fails
- Response includes `loyaltyPointsEarned` field

### 3. Loyalty Points API
**File:** `app/api/user/loyalty/route.js` (NEW)
- **GET**: Fetch current user's loyalty points
- **PATCH**: Redeem/deduct points with validation
  - Checks if user has sufficient points
  - Prevents negative point balances
  - Returns updated point balance

### 4. User Profile API Enhancement
**File:** `app/api/user/route.js`
- Added `loyaltyPoints` field to GET response
- Points now included in user profile data

### 5. Loyalty Management Page
**File:** `app/(loyalty_management)/loyalty/page.js`
- Fetches real-time loyalty points from database
- Displays actual ride history from completed rides
- Integrated redemption system with API calls
- Added loading states for better UX
- Removed manual "Add Ride" section (rides are auto-tracked)

**Features:**
- Real-time points display
- Progress bars for rewards (50 pts = 20% discount, 100 pts = free ride)
- Redemption functionality with API integration
- Ride history from actual database records
- Redemption history tracking

### 6. User Profile Page
**File:** `app/(user-management)/profile/page.js`
- Added loyalty points display in Quick Stats sidebar
- Shows points with star emoji (‚≠ê) in green color
- Points visible across all profile tabs

## How It Works

### Earning Points
1. User completes a bike ride
2. Ride end endpoint (`/api/reservation/end/[id]`) is called
3. System calculates: `loyaltyPoints = Math.floor(distance in km)`
4. Points are automatically added to user's account
5. User can view points in profile or loyalty page

### Viewing Points
- **Profile Page**: Quick Stats sidebar shows current points
- **Loyalty Tab**: Full loyalty dashboard with points, rewards, and history

### Redeeming Points
- **20% Discount**: Requires 50+ points, costs 10 points
- **Free Weekend Ride**: Requires 100+ points, costs 20 points
- Redemptions are processed via API with validation
- Insufficient points are prevented at both UI and API level

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/user/loyalty`
Fetch user's current loyalty points
```json
Response: {
  "loyaltyPoints": 125
}
```

### PATCH `/api/user/loyalty`
Redeem/deduct points
```json
Request: {
  "pointsToDeduct": 10,
  "reason": "20% Discount"
}

Response: {
  "message": "Points redeemed successfully",
  "loyaltyPoints": 115,
  "pointsDeducted": 10,
  "reason": "20% Discount"
}
```

### GET `/api/user`
User profile (includes loyaltyPoints)
```json
Response: {
  "id": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "username": "...",
  "role": "user",
  "loyaltyPoints": 125,
  "usage": { ... }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete a ride and verify points are awarded
- [ ] Check points display in profile Quick Stats
- [ ] Navigate to Loyalty tab and verify points match
- [ ] Verify ride history shows completed rides with points earned
- [ ] Test redemption with sufficient points
- [ ] Test redemption with insufficient points (should fail)
- [ ] Verify points update after redemption
- [ ] Check that points persist across sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Redemption History Persistence**: Store redemptions in database
2. **Point Expiration**: Add expiry dates for points
3. **Bonus Points**: Special events or challenges for extra points
4. **Tiered Rewards**: More reward options at different point levels
5. **Point Transfer**: Allow users to gift points
6. **Leaderboard**: Show top point earners
7. **Notifications**: Alert users when they reach reward thresholds

## Notes

- Points are calculated as `Math.floor(distance)` to ensure whole numbers
- Current ride distance is hardcoded to 20km in the endpoint - update with real GPS tracking
- All API calls include proper error handling and loading states
- System uses optimistic UI updates with server validation
