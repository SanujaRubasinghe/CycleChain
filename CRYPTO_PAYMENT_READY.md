## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **User clicks "Crypto"** → Creates payment record in MongoDB
2. **Clicks "Pay with MetaMask"** → Triggers MetaMask
3. **Chain check** → Automatically switches to Sepolia if needed
4. **Transaction sent** → 0.01 ETH to receiver wallet
5. **Wait for confirmation** → Blockchain confirms (1 block)
6. **Backend verification** → Saves tx hash to database
7. **Status updated** → Payment marked as "completed"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "MetaMask not installed"
→ Install from https://metamask.io/download/

### "Receiver wallet not configured"
→ Already configured! Just restart dev server.

### "Insufficient funds"
→ Get free Sepolia ETH from faucets (see Step 2 above)

### "Wrong network"
→ App will automatically prompt to switch to Sepolia

### "User rejected transaction"
→ Normal! User can try again by clicking "Pay with MetaMask"

### Transaction stuck
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors
→ Ensure MetaMask is unlocked

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

- [ ] Dynamic amount (convert LKR → ETH using price oracle)
- [ ] Support multiple chains (Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum)
- [ ] ERC-20 token payments (USDC, USDT)
- [ ] Transaction receipt email
- [ ] Payment history with Etherscan links

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (not committed)
✅ Using Sepolia testnet (no real money)
✅ Backend verifies transactions on-chain
✅ Transaction hash stored in database
⚠️ For production: Use mainnet and implement proper amount conversion
