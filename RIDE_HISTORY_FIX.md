# ✅ Ride History Update Fix

## The Problem

After completing a crypto payment, the ride was **not showing in the user's ride history** in their profile.

## Root Cause

1. **Payment confirmation** only updated the `Payment` record
2. **Reservation status** was NOT updated to `"completed-paid"`
3. **Ride history API** was not filtering for completed rides properly

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Payment Confirmation API (`/api/payment/[id]/confirm/route.js`)

**Added:**
- Import `Reservation` model
- Update reservation status to `"completed-paid"` after successful payment

**Before:**
```js
payment.status = success ? "completed" : "failed";
await payment.save();
// ❌ Reservation status NOT updated
```

**After:**
```js
payment.status = success ? "completed" : "failed";
await payment.save();

// ✅ Update reservation status
if (success) {
  const reservation = await Reservation.findById(reservationId);
  if (reservation) {
    reservation.status = "completed-paid";
    await reservation.save();
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Ride History API (`/api/user/rides/route.js`)

**Fixed:**
- Filter to show only completed rides
- Fixed field name from `endTime` to `end_time`

**Before:**
```js
const rides = await Reservation.find({ userId: session.user.id })
  .sort({ endTime: -1 })  // ❌ Wrong field name
  .limit(10);
```

**After:**
```js
const rides = await Reservation.find({ 
  userId: session.user.id,
  status: { $in: ["completed-payment-pending", "completed-paid"] }  // ✅ Filter completed rides
})
  .sort({ end_time: -1 })  // ✅ Correct field name
  .lean();
```

---

## Reservation Status Flow

```
1. User books ride
   Status: "reserved"
   
2. User starts ride
   Status: "in_progress"
   
3. User ends ride
   Status: "completed-payment-pending"
   
4. User pays with crypto ✅ FIXED
   Status: "completed-paid"
   
5. Ride appears in history ✅
```

---

## How It Works Now

### After Crypto Payment:

1. **User clicks "Pay with MetaMask"**
2. **Transaction confirmed on blockchain**
3. **Payment API called** (`/api/payment/[id]/confirm`)
   - Updates `Payment.status = "completed"`
   - Updates `Payment.transactionId = txHash`
   - **✅ Updates `Reservation.status = "completed-paid"`** (NEW!)
4. **User goes to Profile → Ride History**
5. **API fetches rides** with status `"completed-paid"`
6. **✅ Ride appears in history table!**

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/api/payment/[id]/confirm/route.js`
- Added `Reservation` import
- Added reservation status update logic
- Logs confirmation message

### 2. `/app/api/user/rides/route.js`
- Added status filter for completed rides
- Fixed field name (`end_time` instead of `endTime`)
- Removed limit (shows all rides)

---

## Testing

### Test the Fix:

1. **Complete a ride**
2. **Go to payment page**
3. **Pay with crypto (MetaMask)**
4. **Wait for confirmation**
5. **Go to Profile → Ride History tab**
6. **✅ Ride should now appear in the table!**

### Check the Data:

**Ride History Table shows:**
- Bike ID
- Start Time
- End Time
- Distance (km)
- Cost (LKR)

## Database Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `reserved` | Ride booked, not started |
| `in_progress` | Ride currently active |
| `completed-payment-pending` | Ride ended, payment not done |
| `completed-paid` | ✅ Ride ended, payment completed |
| `cancelled` | Ride cancelled |

---

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Reservation status now updates to `"completed-paid"` after crypto payment
✅ **Fixed:** Ride history API filters for completed rides
✅ **Fixed:** Field name corrected (`end_time`)
✅ **Result:** Paid rides now appear in user profile ride history!

**Your ride history will now update correctly after crypto payments!** 🎉
